    "<b>You are given an undirected graph G, with N vertices and E edges, and a start node S. You have to find the arrival and the departure time for each node,if a single pointer is used to traverse all the nodes,starting from the node S. Refer the sample input for better understanding. It takes one unit of time to move from one node to another.\n",
